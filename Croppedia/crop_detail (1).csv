"RICE","As a?cereal grain, domesticated rice is the most widely consumed?staple food?for over half of the world's?human population,[Liu 1]?especially in?Asia?and?Africa. It is the agricultural?commodity?with the third-highest worldwide production (rice, 741.5?million metric tons or 817.4?million short tons in 2014), after?sugarcane?(1.9?billion metric tons or 2.1?billion short tons) and?maize?(1.0?billion metric tons or 1.1?billion short tons)","medium depth; waterlogged, submergence, and flood prone","The seeds of the rice plant are first milled using a rice huller to remove the chaff (the outer husks of the grain) (see: rice hulls). At this point in the process, the product is called brown rice. The milling may be continued, removing the bran, i.e., the rest of the husk and the germ, thereby creating white rice. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the disease beriberi.

Either by hand or in a rice polisher, white rice may be buffed with glucose or talc powder (often called polished rice, though this term may also refer to white rice in general), parboiled, or processed into flour. White rice may also be enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.","In late 2007 to May 2008, the price of grains rose greatly due to droughts in major producing countries (particularly Australia), increased use of grains for animal feed and US subsidies for bio-fuel production. Although there was no shortage of rice on world markets this general upward trend in grain prices led to panic buying by consumers, government rice export bans (in particular, by Vietnam and India) and inflated import orders by the Philippines marketing board, the National Food Authority. This caused significant rises in rice prices. In late April 2008, prices hit 24 US cents a pound, twice the price of seven months earlier. Over the period of 2007 to 2013, the Chinese government has substantially increased the price it pays domestic farmers for their rice, rising to US$500 per metric ton by 2013. The 2013 price of rice originating from other southeast Asian countries was a comparably low US$350 per metric ton.","In 2017, world production of paddy rice was 769.7 million metric tons (848.4 million short tons)s, led by China and India with a combined 49% of this total.Other major producers were Indonesia, Bangladesh and Vietnam. The five major producers accounted for 72% of total production, while the top fifteen producers accounted for 91% of total world production in 2017 (see table on right). Developing countries account for 95% of the total production."
"WHEAT","Wheat?is a grass widely?cultivated?for its seed, a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food.?The?many species of wheat?together make up the genus?Triticum; the most widely grown is?common wheat. The?archaeological record?suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the?Fertile Crescent?around 9600?BCE. Botanically, the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a?caryopsis","Yields of pure wheat per unit area increased as methods of crop rotation were applied to long cultivated land, and the use of fertilizers became widespread. Improved agricultural husbandry has more recently included threshing machines,?reaper-binder?machines (the 'combine harvester'),?tractor-drawn cultivators and planters, and better varieties (see?Green Revolution?and?Norin 10 wheat). Great expansion of wheat production occurred as new arable land was farmed in the Americas and Australia in the 19th and 20th centuries.","The presence of certain versions of wheat genes has been important for crop yields. Genes for the 'dwarfing' trait, first used by?Japanese wheat breeders?to produce short-stalked wheat, have had a huge effect on wheat yields worldwide, and were major factors in the success of the?Green Revolution?in Mexico and Asia, an initiative led by?Norman Borlaug. Dwarfing genes enable the carbon that is fixed in the plant during photosynthesis to be diverted towards seed production, and they also help prevent the problem of lodging. 'Lodging' occurs when an ear stalk falls over in the wind and rots on the ground, and heavy nitrogenous fertilization of wheat makes the grass grow taller and become more susceptible to this problem. By 1997, 81% of the developing world's wheat area was planted to semi-dwarf wheats, giving both increased yields and better response to nitrogenous fertilizer","Wheat Futures are available for trading in The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), Euronext, Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT) and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGEX). The standard contract unit is 5,000 bushels. United States is the biggest exporter of wheat followed by the European Union, Australia and Canada. Wheat prices displayed in Trading Economics are based on over-the-counter (OTC) and contract for difference (CFD) financial instruments. Our market prices are intended to provide you with a reference only, rather than as a basis for making trading decisions. Trading Economics does not verify any data and disclaims any obligation to do so.","The most common forms of wheat are white and red wheat. However, other natural forms of wheat exist. Other commercially minor but nutritionally promising species of naturally evolved wheat species include black, yellow and blue wheat"
"MAIZE","Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with the total production of maize surpassing that of wheat or rice. In addition to being consumed directly by humans (often in the form of masa), maize is also used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup.[4] The six major types of maize are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.[5] Sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human consumption as kernels, while field corn varieties are used for animal feed, various corn-based human food uses (including grinding into cornmeal or masa, pressing into corn oil, and fermentation and distillation into alcoholic beverages like bourbon whiskey), and as chemical feedstocks. Maize is also used in making ethanol and other biofuelsSS","Because it is cold-intolerant, in the?temperate zones?maize must be planted in the spring. Its?root?system is generally shallow, so the plant is dependent on soil moisture. As a plant that uses?C4 carbon fixation, maize is a considerably more water-efficient crop than plants that use?C3 carbon fixation?such as?alfalfa?and?soybeans. Maize is most sensitive to drought at the time of silk emergence, when the flowers are ready for pollination. In the United States, a good harvest was traditionally predicted if the maize was ""knee-high by the?Fourth of July"", although modern?hybrids?generally exceed this growth rate. Maize used for?silage?is harvested while the plant is green and the fruit immature. Sweet corn is harvested in the ""milk stage"", after pollination but before starch has formed, between late summer and early to mid-autumn. Field maize is left in the field until very late in the autumn to thoroughly dry the grain, and may, in fact, sometimes not be harvested until winter or even early spring","Before the 20th century, all maize harvesting was by?manual labour, by?grazing, or by some combination of those. Whether the ears were hand-picked and the?stover?was grazed, or the whole plant was cut, gathered, and?shocked, people and?livestock?did all the work. Between the 1890s and the 1970s, the technology of maize harvesting expanded greatly. Today, all such technologies, from entirely manual harvesting to entirely mechanized, are still in use to some degree,?as appropriate to each farm's needs, although the thoroughly mechanized versions predominate, as they offer the lowest?unit costs?when scaled to large farm operations. For small farms, their unit cost can be too high, as their higher?fixed cost?cannot be?amortized?over as many units","As per the current market rates, maximum price of Maize is 2125.00 INR/Quintal in Alangeyam whereas the minimum rate is 1600.00 INR/Quintal in Aliganj across varieties. The average price is 1763.00 INR/Quintal across varieties.","In 2016, maize production was forecast to be over 15 billion?bushels?(380 million metric tons), an increase of 11% over 2014 American production.[103]?Based on conditions as of August 2016, the expected yield would be the highest ever for the United States.[103]?The area of harvested maize was forecast to be 87 million acres (352?000?km2), an increase of 7% over 2015.[103]?Maize is especially popular in?Midwestern?states such as?Indiana?and?Illinois; in the latter, it was named the state's official grain in 2017"
"COTTON","The fiber is most often?spun?into?yarn?or thread and used to make a soft,?breathable?textile. The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated to the fifth millennium BC have been found in the?Indus Valley Civilization, as well as fabric remnants dated back to 6000 BC in?Peru. Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the?cotton gin?that lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used?natural fiber?cloth in clothing today.","The?water footprint?of cotton fibers is substantially larger than for most other plant fibers. Cotton is also known as a thirsty crop; on average, globally, cotton requires 8000-10000 liters of water for one kilogram of cotton, and in dry areas, it may require even more such as in some areas of India, it may need 22500 liters also.","Most cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is harvested mechanically, either by a?cotton picker, a machine that removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant. Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical?defoliant?or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze. Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics, and without defoliation or freezing, the plant will continue to grow.","1KG AROUND 2.5 USD","Organic cotton?is generally understood as cotton from plants not?genetically modified?and that is certified to be grown without the use of any synthetic agricultural chemicals, such as?fertilizers?or?pesticides.[75]?Its production also promotes and enhances biodiversity and biological cycles.[76]?In the United States, organic cotton plantations are required to enforce the?National Organic Program?(NOP). This institution determines the allowed practices for pest control, growing, fertilizing, and handling of organic crops.[77]?As of 2007, 265,517 bales of organic cotton were produced in 24 countries, and worldwide production was growing at a rate of more than 50% per year.[78]?Organic cotton products are now available for purchase at limited locations. These are popular for baby clothes and?diapers; natural cotton products are known to be both sustainable and hypoallergenic"
"SUGARCANE","Sugarcane?or?sugar cane?refers to several species and hybrids of tall?perennial?grass in the genus?Saccharum, tribe?Andropogoneae, that are used for sugar?production. The plants are 2?6 m (6?20?ft) tall with stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in?sucrose, which accumulates in the?stalk internodes. Sugarcanes belong to the grass family,?Poaceae, an economically important?flowering plant?family that includes maize, wheat, rice, and?sorghum, and many?forage?crops. It is native to the warm, temperate tropical regions of India, Southeast Asia, and?New Guinea. The plant is also grown for biofuel production, especially in Brazil, as the canes can be used directly to produce ethyl alcohol","Sugarcane cultivation requires a tropical or?subtropical?climate, with a minimum of 60?cm (24?in) of annual moisture. It is one of the most?efficient?photosynthesizers?in the?plant kingdom. It is a?C4?plant, able to convert up to 1% of incident solar energy into biomass.[30]?In primary growing regions across the tropics and?subtropics, sugarcane crops can produce over 15?kg/m2?of cane. Once a major crop of the southeastern region of the United States, sugarcane cultivation declined there during the late 20th century, and is primarily confined to small plantations in?Florida,?Louisiana, and?southeast Texas?in the 21st century. Sugarcane cultivation ceased in Hawaii when the last operating sugar plantation in the state shut down in 2016","Traditionally, sugarcane processing requires two stages. Mills extract raw sugar from freshly harvested cane and ""mill-white"" sugar is sometimes produced immediately after the first stage at sugar-extraction mills, intended for local consumption. Sugar crystals appear naturally white in color during the crystallization process. Sulfur dioxide is added to inhibit the formation of color-inducing molecules and to stabilize the sugar juices during evaporation.[46][47]?Refineries, often located nearer to consumers in North America, Europe, and Japan, then produce refined white sugar, which is 99% sucrose. These two stages are slowly merging. Increasing affluence in the sugarcane-producing tropics increases demand for refined sugar products, driving a trend toward combined milling and refining.","An official statement said the cost of sugarcane production for the 2021-22 sugar season is??155 a quintal. The fair and remunerative price of ?290 a quintal at a recovery rate of 10% is higher by 87.1% over production cost, thereby giving the farmers a return of much more than 50% over their cost","Worldwide, 26 million hectares were devoted to sugarcane cultivation in 2018.[51]?The average worldwide yield of sugarcane crops in 2018 was 73 tonnes per hectare, led by?Peru?with 121 tonnes per hectare.[51]?The theoretical possible yield for sugarcane is about 280 tonnes per hectare per year, and small experimental plots in Brazil have demonstrated yields of 236?280 tonnes of cane per hectare"
"POTATO","Wild potato?species, originating in modern-day?Peru, can be found throughout the Americas, from?Canada?to southern?Chile.[3]?The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by?Native Americans?independently in multiple locations,[4]?but later genetic testing of the wide variety of?cultivars?and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes, in the area of present-day southern?Peru?and extreme northwestern?Bolivia. Potatoes were?domesticated?approximately 7,000?10,000 years ago there, from a species in the?Solanum brevicaule?complex.[5][6][7]?In the?Andes?region of South America, where the species is?indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.","Potato growth can be divided into five phases. During the first phase, sprouts emerge from the seed potatoes and root growth begins. During the second,?photosynthesis?begins as the plant develops leaves and branches above-ground and?stolons?develop from lower leaf?axils?on the below-ground stem. In the third phase the tips of the stolons swell forming new?tubers?and the shoots continue to grow and flowers typically develop soon after. Tuber bulking occurs during the fourth phase, when the plant begins investing the majority of its resources in its newly formed tubers. At this phase, several factors are critical to a good yield: optimal?soil moisture?and temperature, soil nutrient availability and balance, and resistance to?pest attacks. The fifth phase is the maturation of the tubers: the leaves and stems senesce and the tuber skins harden","At harvest time, gardeners usually dig up potatoes with a long-handled, three-prong ""grape"" (or graip), i.e., a?spading fork, or a potato hook, which is similar to the graip but with tines at a 90??angle to the handle. In larger plots, the plow is the fastest implement for unearthing potatoes. Commercial harvesting is typically done with large?potato harvesters, which scoop up the plant and surrounding earth. This is transported up an apron chain consisting of steel links several feet wide, which separates some of the dirt. The chain deposits into an area where further separation occurs. Different designs use different systems at this point. The most complex designs use vine choppers and shakers, along with a blower system to separate the potatoes from the plant. The result is then usually run past workers who continue to sort out plant material, stones, and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are continuously delivered to a wagon or truck. Further inspection and separation occurs when the potatoes are unloaded from the field vehicles and put into storage.","As per the current market rates, maximum?price of Potato?is 1500.00 INR/Quintal in Hindol whereas the minimum rate is 600.00 INR/Quintal in Sardhana?","In 2018, world production of potatoes was 368 million?tonnes, led by China with 27% of the total (table). Other major producers were India, Russia, Ukraine and the United States. It remains an essential crop in Europe (especially northern and eastern Europe), where per capita production is still the highest in the world, but the most rapid expansion over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia."
"SOYBEAN","Traditional unfermented food uses of soybeans include?soy milk, from which?tofu?and?tofu skin?are made. Fermented soy foods include?soy sauce,?fermented bean paste,?natt?, and?tempeh. Fat-free (defatted) soybean meal is a significant and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many?packaged meals. For example, soybean products, such as?textured vegetable protein?(TVP), are ingredients in many meat and?dairy?substitutes","Soil scientists?Edson Lobato?(Brazil),?Andrew McClung?(U.S.), and?Alysson Paolinelli?(Brazil) were awarded the 2006?World Food Prize?for transforming the ecologically biodiverse savannah of the?Cerrado?region of Brazil into highly productive cropland that could grow profitable soybeans.[50][51][52]?However, even correcting for poor soils soybeans were an unlikely cash crop for the Cerrado. Soy did not fare well in the low latitudes. More than the heat and humidity, it was a lack of seasons that hampered production. In the higher more northerly latitudes, flowering coincides with the summer solstice, when the plants reach their maximum height. The first soybeans planted in the Cerrado, however, flowered early and, deprived of long summer days, remained stunted. For soy agriculture to take root in Mato Grosso it was first necessary to develop a ""tropical soybean""?one that would flower later, giving the plants more time to fully mature. This was accomplished after years of crossbreeding by scientists within?Embrapa, the research arm of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture","The first stage of growth is?germination, a method which first becomes apparent as a seed's?radicle?emerges.[15]?This is the first stage of root growth and occurs within the first 48 hours under ideal growing conditions. The first?photosynthetic?structures, the?cotyledons, develop from the?hypocotyl, the first plant structure to emerge from the soil. These cotyledons both act as leaves and as a source of nutrients for the immature plant, providing the seedling nutrition for its first 7 to 10 days.","Average?Price(Rs./Unit) ? 9,050","n 2019, world production of soybeans was over 334 million tonnes, led by Brazil and the United States combined with 63% of the total (table). Production has dramatically increased across the globe since the 1960s, but particularly in South America after a cultivar that grew well in low latitudes was developed in the 1980s.[68]?The rapid growth of the industry has been primarily fueled by large increases in?worldwide demand for meat?products, particularly in developing countries like China, which alone accounts for more than 60% of imports."
"JUTE","Jute is one of the most affordable?natural fibers, and second only to?cotton?in the amount produced and variety of uses. Jute fibers are composed primarily of the plant materials?cellulose?and?lignin. Jute fiber falls into the?bast fiber?category (fiber collected from bast, the?phloem?of the plant, sometimes called the ""skin"") along with?kenaf,?industrial hemp,?flax?(linen),?ramie, etc.. The industrial term for jute fiber is?raw jute. The fibers are off-white to brown, and 1?4 metres (3?13?feet) long. Jute is also called the ""golden fiber"" for its color and high cash value.","The jute plant needs a plain?alluvial?soil and standing water. The suitable climate for growing jute (warm and wet) is offered by the?monsoon?climate, during the monsoon season. Temperatures from 20?to 40??C (68?104??F) and relative humidity of 70%?80% are favourable for successful cultivation. Jute requires 5?8?cm (2?3?in) of rainfall weekly, and more during the sowing time.?Soft water?is necessary for jute production.","The fibers are used alone or blended with other types of fiber to make?twine?and?rope. Jute butts, the coarse ends of the plants, are used to make inexpensive cloth. Conversely, very fine threads of jute can be separated out and made into?imitation silk. As jute fibers are also being used to make pulp and paper, and with increasing concern over forest destruction for the?wood pulp?used to make most paper, the importance of jute for this purpose may increase. Jute has a long history of use in the sackings, carpets, wrapping fabrics (cotton bale), and construction fabric manufacturing industry","Raw?jute prices?have dropped by 17 per cent over the last couple of months, from over ?9,000 a quintal in mid-June to ?7,500 currently","The jute fiber comes from the stem and ribbon (outer skin) of the jute plant. The fibers are first extracted by?retting. The retting process consists of bundling jute stems together and immersing them in slow running water. There are two types of retting: stem and ribbon. After the retting process, stripping begins; women and children usually do this job. In the stripping process, non-fibrous matter is scraped off, then the workers dig in and grab the fibers from within the jute stem"
"TOMATO","The?tomato?is the edible?berry?of the plant?Solanum lycopersicum,[1][2]?commonly known as a tomato plant. The species originated in western?South America?and?Central America.[2][3]?The?Nahuatl?word?tomatl?gave rise to the Spanish word?tomate, from which the English word?tomato?derived.[3][4]?Its domestication and use as a?cultivated?food may have originated with the?indigenous peoples?of?Mexico.[2][5]?The?Aztecs?used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the?Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the?Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe. From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.","Tomatoes that have been modified using?genetic engineering?have been developed, and although none are?commercially?available now, they have been in the past. The first commercially available?genetically modified food?was a variety of tomato named the?Flavr Savr, which was engineered to have a longer shelf life.[21]?Scientists are continuing to develop tomatoes with new traits not found in natural crops, such as increased resistance to pests or environmental stresses. Other projects aim to enrich tomatoes with substances that may offer health benefits or provide better nutrition.","Pollination and fruit formation depend on?meiosis. Meiosis is central to the processes by which diploid microspore mother cells within the anther give rise to haploid pollen grains, and megaspore mother cells in ovules that are contained within the ovary give rise to haploid nuclei. Union of haploid nuclei from pollen and ovule (fertilization) can occur either by self- or cross-pollination. Fertilization leads to the formation of a diploid zygote that can then develop into an embryo within the emerging seed. Repeated fertilizations within the ovary are accompanied by maturation of the ovary to form the tomato fruit","Till last week the?price of tomato?in Nashik was Rs. 20 per kg. The current?rates of tomato?in Mumbai ranges from Rs. 60-70?","In 2019, world production of tomatoes was 181 million?tonnes, with China accounting for 35% of the total, followed by?India?and?Turkey?as major producers?"
"CABBAGE","A cabbage generally weighs between 500 to 1,000 grams (1 to 2?lb). Smooth-leafed, firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed purple cabbages and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colours being rarer. Under conditions of long sunny days, such as those found at high northern latitudes in summer, cabbages can grow quite large. As of 2012, the heaviest cabbage was 62.71 kilograms (138?lb 4?oz). Cabbage heads are generally picked during the first year of the plant's?life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year and must be kept separate from other?cole crops?to prevent?cross-pollination. Cabbage is prone to several?nutrient deficiencies, as well as to multiple?pests, and bacterial and fungal diseases.","Cabbage is generally grown for its densely leaved heads, produced during the first year of its biennial cycle. Plants perform best when grown in well-drained soil in a location that receives full sun. Different varieties prefer different soil types, ranging from lighter sand to heavier clay, but all prefer fertile ground with a?pH?between 6.0 and 6.8.[53]?For optimal growth, there must be adequate levels of?nitrogen?in the soil, especially during the early head formation stage, and sufficient?phosphorus?and?potassium?during the early stages of expansion of the outer leaves","Plants are generally started in protected locations early in the growing season before being?transplanted?outside, although some are seeded directly into the ground from which they will be harvested.[14]?Seedlings typically emerge in about 4?6 days from seeds planted?13?mm (1?2?in) deep at a soil temperature between 20 and 30??C (68 and 86??F).[56]?Growers normally place plants 30 to 61?cm (12 to 24?in) apart.[14]?Closer spacing reduces the resources available to each plant (especially the amount of light) and increases the time taken to reach maturity.","As per the current market rates, maximum?price of Cabbage?is 1000.00 INR/Quintal in Sangareddy whereas the minimum rate is 800.00 INR/Quintal in Sangareddy","In 2018, world production of cabbages (combined with other brassicas) was 69.4 million?tonnes, led by China with 48% of the world total (table). Other major producers were India, South Korea, and Russia.["
